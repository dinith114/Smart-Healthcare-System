## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Environment Variable

```bash
cd frontend
cat .env
```

Should show:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Check 2: Backend is Running

Visit: http://localhost:5000/api/health

Should return: `{"ok":true}`

### Check 3: Backend Serves Images

1. Upload an image
2. Check browser console (F12)
3. Look for the image URL (something like: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/avatars/avatar-123.jpg`)
4. Copy that URL
5. Paste in browser address bar
6. Should display the image

### Check 4: File Exists

```bash
cd backend/uploads/avatars
ls
```

Should show uploaded image files.

## What Was Changed

### Frontend File:

`frontend/src/components/dashboard/PatientInfoCard.jsx`

**Added:** Helper function to construct full URLs

```javascript
const getFullAvatarUrl = (url) => {
  if (!url) return null;
  if (url.startsWith("http://") || url.startsWith("https://")) {
    return url;
  }
  const baseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:5000";
  return `${baseUrl}${url}`;
};
```

**Updated:** Image display to use full URL

```javascript
<img src={preview || getFullAvatarUrl(avatarUrl)} />
```
