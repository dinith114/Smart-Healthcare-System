# Avatar Feature Setup Guide

## âœ… Installation Complete!

The avatar upload feature has been successfully implemented. Here's what you need to do to get it running:

---

## 1. Install Dependencies

Multer has already been installed in the backend. If you need to reinstall:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

## 2. Create Uploads Directory

The `backend/uploads/avatars/` directory will be created automatically when the first image is uploaded. However, you can create it manually:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
cd backend
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path uploads\avatars
```

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
cd backend
mkdir -p uploads/avatars
```

---

## 3. Set Environment Variable (Frontend)

Create or update `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

This ensures avatar URLs are constructed correctly.

---

## 4. Restart Backend Server

Stop and restart your backend server to load the new routes:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

---

â””â”€â”€ package.json                      âœ“ MODIFIED
```

### Check Frontend Files:

```
frontend/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ components/

### Test API Endpoint:
